# openoakland.org

OpenOakland, an all-volunteer brigade of [Code for America's brigade network](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org), bridges technology and community for a thriving and equitable Oakland. This project is OpenOakland’s website. [openoakland.org](https://openoakland.org) is a place for volunteers, leaders, community members, and anyone interested in the organization to learn more about us and find resources.

## Technology used

- The site is a static [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site.
- We use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) as our CSS framework, in addition to some custom Sass.
- Automatic builds and deploys are handled by [CircleCI](https://circleci.com).
- The site is hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).
  - See more information in the [Deployment](https://github.com/openoakland/openoakland.org/blob/master/.github/contributing.md#deployment) section of our Contributing doc.

## How to Contribute

### Development Options

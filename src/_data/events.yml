# Do not alter the labels (which tells event.html which data to pull).
# If you have a link to the event recording, be sure to include *both* buttonText and link strings. Otherwise the button will display the URL, which is ugly. The buttonText should be sentence case (only the first word is capitalized).
# If your entry includes a colon, wrap the entire entry in double quotes.

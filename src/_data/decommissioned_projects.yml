  description: OakCrime.org seeks to increase transparency and understanding of data released by the Oakland Police Department (OPD) regarding crime. Our data goes back to 2007, and up to yesterday. We strive to make all public OPD data available to citizens ASAP, provide context for it with analytics and visualization, together with full provenance via open source repositories and solid documentation.

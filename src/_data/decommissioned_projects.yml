  description: Members have expressed concerns about how OakCrime contextualizes (or fails to contextualize) police data and the impact of statistical bias on marginalized communities, particularly Black and brown Oaklanders. We see potential for this project to explore these issues more explicitly. Addressing these questions in a Project Brief would be the first step toward evolving the project.

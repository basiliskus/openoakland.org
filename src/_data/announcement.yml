# Use this for adding *temporary* announcements to the site via includes. Note that this doc should hold only one announcement at a time.
# There may be a better way to do this but for now, if we want more than one announcement to appear on the site, just create a second include and accompanying yml/html file pair.
# This include uses the Bootstrap "jumbotron" component with custom css styles in wp.scss.
# Do not alter the labels (which tells event.html which data to pull).
# If your entry includes a colon or other special characters not allowed in yml, wrap the entire entry in double quotes.

  description: "The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Group was created in 2016 to codify OpenOakland’s DEI organizational principles and to lead through action, OpenOakland’s commitment to making the technology space representative of Oakland’s diverse and multicultural community. In 2020, it's become very clear that this foundational shift must extend beyond a single working group. We welcome those who might want to formalize the process through an active working group. In the meantime, please visit us in Slack to connect and continue the work."

  description: As the digital face of OpenOakland, our website serves new and existing members, community and government partners, and members of the larger Oakland and civic tech communities. The site was recently migrated from a Wordpress install to a static Jekyll site hosted on AWS. The migration focused primarily on moving the codebase, and we now are working on improving site architecture and visual design. Issues in GutHub marked "Good First Issue" are great for first-timers.
  tech: Jekyll, Kramdown, Bootstrap UI

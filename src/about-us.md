OpenOakland bridges technology and community for a thriving and equitable Oakland. We do this by:

- **Cultivating meaningful relationships.**  
    By partnering with the city and the community we foster a more inclusive, equitable, and engaged Oakland.

- **Inspiring civic engagement.**  
    We co-create tools and events that educate Oaklanders on how the city works and inspires them to effect civic change.

- **Empowering Oaklanders.**  
    We recognize that Oakland has a rich history of activism. We seek to empower all Oaklanders to keep advocating for our communityâ€˜s collective well-being.

We're a fiscally-sponsored project of [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), a 501(c)3 nonprofit. Donations to OpenOakland are tax-deductible and can be [made through Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/donate-to-a-brigade?utm_campaign=Open%20Oakland&utm_source=OpenOakland%20site) (be sure to select OpenOakland from the drop-down menu after choosing the amount).

## 2021 leadership team

The leadership team is elected by membership annually and generally are members who have been actively engaged in OpenOakland activities for an extended period of time.

If you're interested in joining the leadership team, join us for Hack Night and introduce yourself. In the interest of greater representation, our Communications Lead has committed to sharing or turning the role over if you're interested and identify as Black, Indigenous, or a person of color.


## How you can get involved

- **Join us at Hack Night.**  
    Every Tuesday from 6:30-9:00pm PST, we meet on Zoom (normally, we meet in City Hall but are working remotely during the coronavirus pandemic). After intros on Zoom, we break off into Slack channels to work and you can bounce around to introduce yourself. Don't be shy about joining in; we're friendly folk. [RSVP on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/).

- **Join us on Slack.**  
    Simply [request an invite](http://slack.openoakland.org/) and introduce yourself in #intros. We look forward to meeting you!

- **Contribute to an existing project.**  
    Check out our [active projects](/projects/). You're welcome to contact project leads directly or jump into their Github repos but if you're not a coder or are unsure how you might contribute, we suggest attending Hack Night to get to know our project teams.


**We hope to see you soon!**

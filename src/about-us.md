OpenOakland bridges technology and community for a thriving and equitable Oakland. We do this by:

- **Cultivating meaningful relationships.**  
    By partnering with the city and the community we foster a more inclusive, equitable, and engaged Oakland.

- **Inspiring civic engagement.**  
    We co-create tools and events that educate Oaklanders on how the city works and inspires them to effect civic change.

- **Empowering Oaklanders.**  
    We recognize that Oakland has a rich history of activism. We seek to empower all Oaklanders to keep advocating for our community‘s collective well-being.

## Get involved

- **Join us at Hack Night.**  
    Every Tuesday from 6:30-9:00pm PST, we meet on Zoom (normally, we meet in City Hall but are working remotely during the coronavirus pandemic). [RSVP on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/).

- **Join us on Slack.**  
    Simply [request an invite](http://slack.openoakland.org/) and introduce yourself in #intros. We look forward to meeting you!

- **Contribute to an existing project.**  
    Check out our [active projects](/projects/). You're welcome to contact project leads directly or jump into their Github repos but if you're not a coder or are unsure how you might contribute, we suggest attending Hack Night to get to know our project teams. After intros on Zoom, we break off into Slack channels to work and you can bounce around to introduce yourself. Don't be shy about joining in; we're friendly folk.

- **Be cool.**  
    Please be sure to read our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/).


## Elected leadership
{% include steering-committee.html %}

### Governance and decision-making

OpenOakland is a fiscally-sponsored project of [Code for America](codeforamerica.org/), a 501(c)3 nonprofit, and is governed by a set of [bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QR-fr1WnmXkZoVNmWnZ9drzfmaZoPkodEOx-PkExt94/) that outline leadership roles, project requirements, decision-making processes, and brigade policies.

We're led by a leadership team elected by membership each year, whose primary means of decision-making is via a monthly Steering Committee meeting. A member from each [active project](/projects/) team should also attend the Steering Committee meeting each month. It doesn’t need to always be the same person, but it should be part of the core team. All OpenOakland members are welcome to sit in on these meetings.

  ## Ongoing projects that support OpenOakland's operation
  These projects are a great way to get your feet wet as you get to know OpenOakland.

  {% for project in site.data.openoakland_projects %}
    {% include project.html %}
  {% endfor %}

---

  ## Active projects
  The following projects are official OpenOakland projects that are being actively supported by an existing project team. If you see something that interests you, there are a couple of ways you can get involved:
  - Join us for our Tuesday [Hack Nights](https://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/events/) to connect with the project team.
  - Join our [Slack workspace](http://slack.openoakland.org/) and introduce yourself in the project's channel listed in the description.

  {% for project in site.data.active_projects %}
    {% include project.html %}
  {% endfor %}

---

  ## Inactive projects
  The following projects aren’t currently being worked on by a project team and are considered dormant. If you're interested in resuming one of these projects, you'll need to start by updating or completing a new [Project Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing) (most of these projects were developed prior to our current project development process and will need to go through the new process to resume).

  {% for project in site.data.inactive_projects %}
    {% include project.html %}
  {% endfor %}

---

  ## Decommissioned projects
  Decommissioned projects are projects that the Steering Committee has formally reviewed and deemed no longer a good fit for OpenOakland based on our 2020 project evaluation pilot. These projects may not be reinstated without submitting a new [Project Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing) that substantively addresses the original reasons for discontinuation. Project briefs that are declined by the Steering Committee twice may not be resubmitted without substantive changes.

  {% for project in site.data.decommissioned_projects %}
    {% include project.html %}
  {% endfor %}

  ## Becoming an OpenOakland project
  In response to member feedback that has resulted in an ongoing effort to address issues of equity and inclusion in our work, OpenOakland is reevaluating how our projects are vetted, adopted, and developed. This is an ongoing pilot that we continue to iterate on in an effort to ensure that projects serve their intended communities, consider potential unintended consequences, and foster greater inclusion of community voices—particularly those from underrepresented and underserved Oakland communities.

  If you have a new idea for an OpenOakland project:

  1. **Fill out the [Project Brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing)**. We encourage you to join our [Slack workspace](http://slack.openoakland.org/) and share your draft with our membership, so we can collaborate together as you develop your idea.

  2. **Submit your draft brief to the #leadership channel** on Slack for formal consideration. Provided your brief is submitted at least two weeks in advance, it will be reviewed at the next Steering Committee meeting (a group of elected leadership and existing project reps), and you'll get some initial feedback and be asked to make adjustments accordingly.

  3. **Make any requested adjustments** based on the Steering Committee's feedback and resubmit the final brief.

  Once your final brief is submitted, the Steering Committee will hold a formal vote to approve or decline the project.

  ### What makes a good project?
We generally consider the following types of projects:
- **Civic tech projects:** providing tools or services to Oaklanders or public agencies to increase access to and understanding of government.
- **Events:** major events that require a team to execute.
- **OpenOakland sustainability projects:** efforts to improve and sustain OpenOakland as an organization.

  Projects must demonstrate alignment to OpenOakland’s mission and values. Some ways a project might do so include:
- Partnering with organizations to serve as domain experts in the needs of the community it serves
- Forming a project team which has lived experience with the issue the project is focused on
- Conducting user research to understand the needs of the community the project serves

  ## Providing feedback

  In the spirit of continuous improvement and self-reflection, we welcome any and all feedback.

  If you’d like to contribute to or provide feedback on the project evaluation process or on any individual projects, we invite you to share your thoughts at our [next Hack Night](https://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/events/), join the conversation in our [Slack workspace](http://slack.openoakland.org/), or email our [Steering Committee](mailto:steering@openoakland.org). You may also email concerns or comments to [safespace@openoakland.org](mailto:safespace@openoakland.org), which is staffed by two OpenOakland [ombudspeople](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QR-fr1WnmXkZoVNmWnZ9drzfmaZoPkodEOx-PkExt94/edit#heading=h.3t0te9n2wr7m).

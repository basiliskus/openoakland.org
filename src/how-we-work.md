OpenOakland is led by a core team of elected representatives (known as Elects), supported by a Steering Committee that makes most major decisions.

We subscribe to Code for America's [tenet](https://www.codeforamerica.org/values) that _no one is coming; it's up to us_. We strive for consensus as much as possible and are continually working to build a collaborative community where members have the flexibility to lean into action, while maintaining accountability to each other and our broader Oakland community.


## Brigade structure

Brigade membership is open to all, regardless of expertise or skill level. The brigade is led by core team of elected leads. Activities and formal decision-making are overseen by a Steering Committee, which meets monthly and consists of the elected leads plus project representatives.

Appointed roles include two ombuds people and one steering committee chairperson.](/assets/images/OpenOakland-leadership-structure.png)

The brigade has two Ombudspeople, Mary Yeh and Ronald Pineda (available at <a href="mailto:safespace@openoakland.org">safespace@openoakland.org</a>), who are available to anyone who wishes to provide feedback, express concerns, report a Code of Conduct violation, or otherwise seek support.


### How the Steering Committee works

The Steering Committee follows a set of [bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QR-fr1WnmXkZoVNmWnZ9drzfmaZoPkodEOx-PkExt94/) that outline leadership roles, project requirements, decision-making processes, and additional brigade policies. _All OpenOakland members are welcome to sit in on the committee's monthly meetings._

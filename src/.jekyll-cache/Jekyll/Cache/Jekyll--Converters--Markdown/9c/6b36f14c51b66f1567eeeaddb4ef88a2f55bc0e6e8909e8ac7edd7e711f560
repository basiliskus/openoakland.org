I"4<p>OpenOakland bridges technology and community for a thriving and equitable Oakland. We do this by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cultivating meaningful relationships.</strong><br />
  By partnering with the city and the community we foster a more inclusive, equitable, and engaged Oakland.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inspiring civic engagement.</strong><br />
  We co-create tools and events that educate Oaklanders on how the city works and inspires them to effect civic change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Empowering Oaklanders.</strong><br />
  We recognize that Oakland has a rich history of activism. We seek to empower all Oaklanders to keep advocating for our community‘s collective well-being.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

In the interest of greater representation, our Communications Lead has committed to sharing or turning the role over if you’re interested and identify as Black, Indigenous, or a person of color (reach out in #oo-steering-committee if interested).</p>

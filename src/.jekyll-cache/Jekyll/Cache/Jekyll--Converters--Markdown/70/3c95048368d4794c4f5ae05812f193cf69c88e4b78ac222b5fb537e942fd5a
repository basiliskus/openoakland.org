I"Ã<p><strong>OpenOaklandâ€™s volunteer contributors are the lifeblood of our brigade. We may have different backgrounds and experiences of our city but weâ€™re united in our belief that technology can be a tool to empower communities and make government more representative of the people it serves. As we carry Oaklandâ€™s Pride Month celebration forward into our daily lives, weâ€™d like to start introducing you to some of these members.</strong></p>

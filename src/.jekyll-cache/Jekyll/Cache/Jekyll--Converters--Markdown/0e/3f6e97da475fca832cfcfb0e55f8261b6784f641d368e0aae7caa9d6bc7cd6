          <div class="card-text">As the digital face of OpenOakland, our website serves new and existing members, community and government partners, and members of the larger Oakland and civic tech communities. The site was recently migrated from a Wordpress install to a static Jekyll site hosted on AWS. The migration focused primarily on moving the codebase, and we now are working on improving site architecture and visual design. Issues in GutHub marked “Good First Issue” are great for first-timers.</div>

Our initial effort is focused on a volunteer-friendly database for WOEIP staff and volunteers to manage and explore the local AQ data they collect through the organization’s citizen science program. We’ll then build on this to create a neighborhood-friendly platform that allows residents to act on this data through self-education, self-empowerment, and civic engagement.</div>

          <div class="card-text">RADAR is exploring how we can use OpenOakland’s particular data expertise to further the needs of our community and government partners by supplementing their own internal capacity, thereby amplifying their impact. Our hypothesis is that creating an off-the-shelf request service for well-scoped, time-bound, data-centric projects can help potential partners make better use of OpenOakland’s services, create a more consistent pipeline of mission-aligned projects for the brigade, and allow us to more directly serve our mission through the strength of our volunteers. OpenOakland RADAR is inspired by BetaNYC’s existing program.</div>

The app was intended to help neighbors report issues and work together with the Oakland City Public Works Agency to remove trash, dead animals, and other consequences of illegal dumping in East Oakland neighborhoods. The goal was for Trash Talk to eventually connect with the City‘s existing tracking app, [SeeClickFix](https://en.seeclickfix.com/oakland) for tracking volunteer time.</div>

Adopt a Drain was set up in partnership with [City of Oakland’s Public Works Agency](http://www2.oaklandnet.com/government/o/PWA/o/FE/s/ID/OAK024735#Drain).</div>

          <div class="card-text">In 2017, City of Oakland expanded their medical cannabis licensing to include regulation for cultivation and manufacturing. As part of this activity, the City also codified an Equity Licensing Program to address barriers to participation in the industry for members of disenfranchised communities in Oakland. This program includes a provision for “equity business incubators” to support new businesses in the industry. Equity businesses in the pipeline will be importantant to regular applicants, because regular licenses will only be issued on a one-to-one basis with equity licenses during the initial phase of the program. The incubator opportunity is intended to help new enterprises overcome the barrier of securing commercial space by incentivizing more established businesses to agree to share their existing space for a minimum of three years. By partnering with an equity business, a regular applicant will be moved to the top of the list for the next available non-equity cannabis business license.
To support the Equity Licensing Program, OpenOakland provided support to other volunteer technologists and cannabis entrepreneurs working with the City of Oakland’s City Administrator’s Office and the Department of Race and Equity to develop [CannaEquity.org](http://cannaequity.org/), an online “matchmaking” application that would assist interested equity and regular applicants to locate each other efficiently. Applicants would create online accounts to pre-screen for compatibility and control the pace of information sharing and relationship building needed for the formation of space-sharing relationships. The app will be maintained until the end of phase one of licensing. This date will be determined by the collection of cannabis tax revenue sufficient to launch the next phase of equity applicant support services (assumed to be within one year).</div>

          <div class="card-text">The fifth annual CityCamp successfully took place on Saturday, March 25, 2017 at Oakland City Hall. CityCamp is an unstructured conference where municipal employees, civic leaders, technology folks, software developers, journalists, and engaged residents can meet and discuss the intersections of technology and local government—how innovative technology and data uses can improve civic engagement, increase efficiency and transparency, connect residents, and incubate the technology community in our city. Unconferences are not structured up-front; the agenda is completed on the day based on topics the attendees themselves suggest. This gives attendees control over the topics and discussion happening at the event, so residents can drive attention towards issues they think are most important.</div>

          <div class="card-text">Soft Story is a simple interactive map of potential soft-story buildings in Oakland. Soft-story buildings are multi-unit, wood-frame, residential buildings with a first story that lacks adequate strength or stiffness to prevent leaning or collapse in an earthquake. These buildings pose a safety risk to tenants and occupants, a financial risk to owners, and risk the recovery of the city and region. This data shows the results of a screening program for potential soft-story buildings in Oakland. In 2008 Oakland surveyed its multi-family buildings with five or more units, and in 2009 passed an ordinance that required the owners of these buildings to complete a simple evaluation of the ground floor. This data shows the results of these screenings as of early 2013.</div>

          </div>

          <div class="card-text">Approximately one million California residents currently only have access to drinking water that does not meet state and federal standards. The California Drinking Water project provides user-friendly online queries, charts, and maps to show which water systems have current and persistent drinking water contamination violations. Partnering with the State Water Board and the Community Water Center non-profit organization, Open Oakland volunteers developed a tool features using the State’s bi-monthly Human Right to Water water quality reporting data on cities, communities, schools, and daycares. The online features allow government officials, advocates, researchers, and residents to more easily understand which water systems have contamination problems and identify solutions that support clean water for all Californians. Used daily by local grassroots organizations, the site won awards at two consecutive Water Data Challenges.</div>

<h2 id="status-definitions">Status definitions</h2>

<h3 id="active"><span class="badge badge-success">Active</span></h3>

<p>These projects are actively supported by a core team of OpenOakland volunteers. To contribute or provide feedback, see <a href="#get-involved">Get involved</a>.</p>

<h3 id="incubating"><span class="badge badge-info">Incubating</span></h3>

<p>Incubating projects are in the exploratory or start-up phase before becoming an official OpenOakland project. To be listed as an incubating project, ideas must have a draft <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing">project exploration worksheet</a> completed, an acting lead shepherding the idea, and be actively recruiting collaborators. Placement on the website is at the discretion of the Steering Committee.</p>

<h3 id="brigade-ops"><span class="badge badge-primary">Brigade ops</span></h3>

<p>These projects support OpenOakland’s operations. Like <span class="badge badge-success">Active</span> and <span class="badge badge-info">Incubating</span> projects, they are <a href="#get-involved">open to volunteer contributions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="idle"><span class="badge badge-secondary">Idle</span></h3>

<p>Sometimes projects go quiet when the core team gets too busy or disbands. If you’d like to resume or adapt one of these, submit a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing">project exploration worksheet</a> at an upcoming Hack Night or in Slack’s #oo-steering-committee channel.</p>

<h3 id="delivered"><span class="badge badge-dark">Delivered</span></h3>

<p>Delivered projects have either reached their intended conclusion or been handed off to a partner for long-term management. Because most of OpenOakland’s work is open source, these projects can often be reproduced or adapted by anyone with an interest in doing so.</p>

<h3 id="decommissioned"><span class="badge badge-warning">Decommissioned</span></h3>

<p>These are projects the Steering Committee has formally reviewed and deemed no longer a good fit for OpenOakland. These projects may not be reinstated without submitting a new <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing">project exploration worksheet</a> that substantively addresses the original reasons for discontinuation. Project briefs that are declined by the Steering Committee twice may not be resubmitted without substantive changes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="get-involved">Get involved</h2>
<p>There are several ways to contribute to an existing project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Join us for our Tuesday <a href="https://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/events/">meetups</a> to connect with the project team.</li>
  <li>Join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/openoakland/shared_invite/zt-n4d7tx2t-UVIN7a769e4oc9j7PgM3HA">Slack workspace</a> and introduce yourself in the project’s channel listed in the description (see our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VWZQ_3ehP5j0IOTY0nJClvQPll3ivSkuAdh5YsOhO_U/edit?usp=sharing">OpenOakland Slack Guide</a> for help).</li>
  <li>Email <a href="mailto:steering@openoakland.org">steering@openoakland.org</a> with any questions or feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="starting-an-openoakland-project">Starting an OpenOakland project</h3>

<p>OpenOakland is reevaluating how our projects are vetted, adopted, and developed. This is an ongoing pilot that we continue to iterate on in an effort to ensure that projects serve their intended communities, consider potential unintended consequences, and foster greater inclusion of community voices—particularly those from underrepresented and underserved Oakland communities.</p>

<p>If you have a new idea for an OpenOakland project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing">project exploration worksheet</a></strong>. We encourage you to join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/openoakland/shared_invite/zt-n4d7tx2t-UVIN7a769e4oc9j7PgM3HA">Slack workspace</a> and share your draft with our membership, so we can collaborate together as you develop your idea.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Submit your draft brief to the #oo-steering-committee channel</strong> on Slack for formal consideration. Provided your brief is submitted at least two weeks in advance, it will be reviewed at the next Steering Committee meeting (a group of elected leadership and existing project reps), and you’ll get some initial feedback and be asked to make adjustments accordingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make any requested adjustments</strong> based on the Steering Committee’s feedback and resubmit the final brief.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once your final brief is submitted, the Steering Committee will hold a formal vote to approve or decline the project.</p>

<h4 id="what-makes-a-good-project">What makes a good project?</h4>

<p>We generally consider the following types of projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Civic tech projects:</strong> providing tools or services to Oaklanders or public agencies to increase access to and understanding of government.</li>
  <li><strong>Events:</strong> major events that require a team to execute.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenOakland sustainability projects:</strong> efforts to improve and sustain OpenOakland as an organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Projects must demonstrate alignment to OpenOakland’s mission and values. Some ways a project might do so include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Partnering with organizations to serve as domain experts in the needs of the community it serves</li>
  <li>Forming a project team which has lived experience with the issue the project is focused on</li>
  <li>Conducting user research to understand the needs of the community the project serves</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="providing-feedback">Providing feedback</h2>

<p>In the spirit of continuous improvement and self-reflection, we welcome any and all feedback on OpenOakland projects past and present, as well as the overall project management process. Ways you can share your input include:</p>

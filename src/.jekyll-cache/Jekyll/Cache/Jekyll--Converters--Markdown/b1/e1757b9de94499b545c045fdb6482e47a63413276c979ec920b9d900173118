<p><strong>OpenOakland’s volunteer contributors are the lifeblood of our brigade. They come from a mind-boggling array of backgrounds and have wildly different experiences of our city. As we carry Oakland’s Pride Month celebration forward into our daily lives, we’d like to take a moment to pause and shine the light on some of these members. Today, we start with Sean Martinez, OpenOakland’s volunteer Treasurer/Recorder. Sean kindly sat down with Jess Sand, one of his co-leads, to talk about the unique perspective he brings to the brigade, the role of empathy in policy making, and the challenges—and joy—of learning and growing from a diverse community. The interview has been edited for length and flow.</strong></p>

<h3 id="jess-to-start-why-dont-you-tell-me-a-little-bit-about-yourself-outside-of-openoakland-whats-your-background-what-do-you-do-who-are-you-sean"><strong>Jess:</strong> To start, why don’t you tell me a little bit about yourself outside of OpenOakland. What’s your background, what do you do? Who are you, Sean?</h3>

<p><strong>Sean:</strong> I’m a researcher. I’ve done research in health care policy and domestic violence. I originally started doing economic research. My parents were very adamant that I get an MBA at some point or get my masters. And I decided, you know, what, I’m not going to do that at all, I’m going to do something for society for a little bit. So when I graduated college, I realized maybe I should work for a nonprofit. This was in 2015. And then suddenly, 2016 happened and everything kind of fell apart. So I stuck around, continuing to do research and policy-making in the nonprofit field until now, where I now live in the East Bay and I feel really connected to a lot of organizations. But I still feel like I’m growing my connections elsewhere, and always learning. So it’s really exciting. And I always feel like I have something new to learn all the time.</p>

<p>It feels like everything was just an accident when I started. I didn’t mean to stay in the nonprofit world for so long. I didn’t mean to do this kind of research and policymaking for this long. But I had way too much fun along the way, I met so many great people—incredible activists who really pushed my own thinking in terms of my own politics and my own understanding of what social justice really means. And I just kept going along for the ride.</p>

<h3 id="jess-you-said-you-started-off-in-research-in-the-domestic-violence-space-and-the-justice-space-generally-were-those-separate-parts-of-your-life-that-came-together-or-did-one-lead-to-another"><strong>Jess:</strong> You said you started off in research, in the domestic violence space and the justice space generally. Were those separate parts of your life that came together or did one lead to another?</h3>

<p><strong>Sean:</strong> It was more by accident. I wrote a couple of research papers touching on economic policymaking and urbanism, and how that informs how we think about public safety and the kinds of tools that we use to create public safety. It made me realize that there are these other pieces of my own identity that help inform or gloss over things.</p>

<p>For example, I’m male-identified; I was designated male at birth. When I started doing that kind of research for domestic violence, I realized, wow, I don’t know what it’s like to be a woman walking through a parking garage at night. And I don’t know what kinds of things I would feel, or the things I would hear, or the things I would be concerned about. And that just creates my own blinders in terms of, what are the policies that I think are viable? Or what are the policies that are even relevant? And it really pushed me to get into other people’s shoes and really listen. And that was a really hard skill to learn when you’re a hotshot and you think you know everything because you have all this quantitative knowledge. You’re like, <em>I don’t need your stories. I have data.</em> But obviously that’s wrong. And pushing myself to be more empathetic and be more connected to others—that really made my work more nuanced. It made my work much more interesting.</p>

<h3 id="jess-was-there-a-particular-incident-or-moment-or-person-that-got-you-there-or-was-that-something-you-evolved-into-because-i-dont-think-of-that-as-being-a-typical-evolution-in-thinking-i-mean-i-think-a-lot-of-people-in-the-research-and-policy-world-dont-necessarily-end-up-there-with-that-empathetic-mindset"><strong>Jess:</strong> Was there a particular incident or moment, or person, that got you there? Or was that something you evolved into? Because I don’t think of that as being a typical evolution in thinking. I mean, I think a lot of people in the research and policy world don’t necessarily end up there, with that empathetic mindset.</h3>

<p><strong>Sean:</strong> When I was in LA, I met a group who worked in North Hollywood, Pacific Palisades, and the Ojai area. I remember asking people, what is it like, who are the people that you serve? And they described a lot of women who are RV campers, who are fleeing their partners because they themselves are victims of intimate partner violence. And that really struck me. Because my vision of a person who is living in an RV camper on the street was very much informed by class and maleness and even ableism around things like mental health. It didn’t register with me that there was this gender component.</p>

<p>And it really challenged me. Why did I not think about that? And it was in that process of being surprised, of interrogating my own self, that I really started to become less of an asshole and more of a well-rounded and more receptive person. And I think that in my own work now, that’s a hard line to balance, being able to make really broad recommendations in terms of policy, but then being able to thread the line and talk about nuance. And, you know, the better you are at recognizing that nuance, the harder it is to make really big claims about what the right policy is sometimes.</p>

<h3 id="jess-its-interesting-to-hear-you-talk-about-discovering-your-own-biases-like-that-i-mean-youre-an-asian-american-working-in-the-technology-space-and-youre-also-openly-gay-so-you-have-certain-experiences-that-someone-like-me-as-a-straight-white-woman-doesnt-have-yet-youre-very-aware-of-your-own-positionality-can-you-say-more-about-how-that-awareness-of-your-own-position-in-relationship-to-others-and-your-own-intersectional-identity-in-particular-informs-your-work"><strong>Jess:</strong> It’s interesting to hear you talk about discovering your own biases like that. I mean, you’re an Asian American working in the technology space and you’re also openly gay. So you have certain experiences that someone like me, as a straight, white woman, doesn’t have. Yet you’re very aware of your own positionality. Can you say more about how that awareness of your own position in relationship to others, and your own intersectional identity in particular, informs your work?</h3>

<p><strong>Sean:</strong> Going back a long time ago, when I first graduated, I was like, “yeah, I’m a hotshot, I understand everything.” But then getting checked on understanding that my own intersections are not other people’s intersections—that was really an important wake-up call for me. To realize I still have a lot to learn and other people have a lot to learn, too. And if <em>I’m</em> thinking about this, then how can I help other people think through this, too?</p>

<p>My own experiences have given me this feeling—an instinct—when feeling out these questions of, like, what should we be doing? How should we address this question? What are the policy implications? And just honing in on those instincts or recognizing that there is something there. My experiences are very different than another Asian person’s experience or another gay person’s experience. But recognizing that there is some sort of instinct that says, “Wait a second, they’re saying something that is analogous. I wonder what that is about?” Or, “Someone is saying something different; I wonder where that’s coming from and how that might affect or shape their understanding?”</p>

<p>For me, having that intersectional identity and those instincts has only made me want to bring that instinct out of other people, too. Because if I can help other people have that sense of, you know, “this person is bringing up a theme that I am not really familiar with”—I want them to own that and say, “I want to dive into that deeper,” or “I want to figure that out or learn more about that.”</p>

<p>I think in our work, we need to be doing that all the time. It’s hard because that instinct can be buried by a lot of things. We try to be empirical about things or overly scientific about things. Or maybe it’s just really uncomfortable. But my job has been to let people say, “you know, this is <em>interesting</em>. And I don’t know what’s going on here but I want to keep the conversation going.”</p>

<h3 id="jess-what-does-that-look-like-in-practice"><strong>Jess:</strong> What does that look like in practice?</h3>

<p><strong>Sean:</strong> I think it means letting other people fall down and pick themselves up. For example, there was a time some of us on the <a href="https://openbudgetoakland.com">Open Budget</a> team had some really differing opinions about what policing looks like in Oakland. What is the responsibility of the police? And how should that be rolled out in the budget? And everyone was operating at different levels, or different perspectives. I <em>could</em> just go in and tell people what to think, or I can let other people figure it out for themselves.</p>

<p>And that meant building in safe spaces to have those conversations. It meant me reaching out to people one on one, and asking them how they feel. And maybe presenting them with different resources or differing perspectives, or supporting evidence. But it also meant just sitting back and being a fly on the wall and watching the conversation unfold.
But there was a very nuanced discussion as a result. People were able to really see not just traditional versions of identity such as race, class and gender, but they were able to see new versions of identity such as, what neighborhood are you from? What age are you? What is your able-bodied status? What has your experience been with the police before? And these differing perspectives, these different intersections of one’s experience, have really taught others to be more nuanced and be more thoughtful. And I think, as a result, people are really having complicated opinions, and I love that.</p>

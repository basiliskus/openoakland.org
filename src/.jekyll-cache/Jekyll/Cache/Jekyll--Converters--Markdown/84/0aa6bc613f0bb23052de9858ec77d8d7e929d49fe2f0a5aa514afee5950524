<ul>
  <li>Join us for our Tuesday <a href="https://www.meetup.com/OpenOakland/events/">Hack Nights</a> to connect with the project team.</li>
  <li>Join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/openoakland/shared_invite/zt-n4d7tx2t-UVIN7a769e4oc9j7PgM3HA">Slack workspace</a> and introduce yourself in the project‚Äôs channel listed in the description (see our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VWZQ_3ehP5j0IOTY0nJClvQPll3ivSkuAdh5YsOhO_U/edit?usp=sharing">OpenOakland Slack Guide</a> for help).</li>

          <div class="card-text">As the digital face of OpenOakland, our website serves new and existing members, community and government partners, and members of the larger Oakland and civic tech communities. The site was recently migrated from a Wordpress install to a static Jekyll site hosted on AWS. The migration focused primarily on moving the codebase, and we now are working on improving site architecture and visual design. Issues in GutHub marked ‚ÄúGood First Issue‚Äù are great for first-timers.</div>

<h2 id="starting-an-openoakland-project">Starting an OpenOakland project</h2>

<p>OpenOakland is reevaluating how our projects are vetted, adopted, and developed. This is an ongoing pilot that we continue to iterate on in an effort to ensure that projects serve their intended communities, consider potential unintended consequences, and foster greater inclusion of community voices‚Äîparticularly those from underrepresented and underserved Oakland communities.</p>

<p>If you have a new idea for an OpenOakland project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing">project exploration worksheet</a></strong>. We encourage you to join our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/openoakland/shared_invite/zt-n4d7tx2t-UVIN7a769e4oc9j7PgM3HA">Slack workspace</a> and share your draft with our membership, so we can collaborate together as you develop your idea.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Submit your draft brief to the #oo-steering-committee channel</strong> on Slack for formal consideration. Provided your brief is submitted at least two weeks in advance, it will be reviewed at the next Steering Committee meeting (a group of elected leadership and existing project reps), and you‚Äôll get some initial feedback and be asked to make adjustments accordingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make any requested adjustments</strong> based on the Steering Committee‚Äôs feedback and resubmit the final brief.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once your final brief is submitted, the Steering Committee will hold a formal vote to approve or decline the project.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-a-good-project">What makes a good project?</h3>

<p>We generally consider the following types of projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Civic tech projects:</strong> providing tools or services to Oaklanders or public agencies to increase access to and understanding of government.</li>
  <li><strong>Events:</strong> major events that require a team to execute.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenOakland sustainability projects:</strong> efforts to improve and sustain OpenOakland as an organization.</li>
</ul>

<p>Projects must demonstrate alignment to OpenOakland‚Äôs mission and values. Some ways a project might do so include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Partnering with organizations to serve as domain experts in the needs of the community it serves</li>
  <li>Forming a project team which has lived experience with the issue the project is focused on</li>
  <li>Conducting user research to understand the needs of the community the project serves</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="incubating-projects">Incubating projects</h3>

<p>Projects with the <span class="badge badge-info">Incubating</span> label are not official OpenOakland projects yet. To be listed as an incubating project, ideas must have a draft <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing">project exploration worksheet</a> completed, an acting lead shepherding the idea, and be actively recruiting collaborators. Placement on the website is at the discretion of the Steering Committee.</p>

<h3 id="inactive-projects">Inactive projects</h3>

<p>Projects with the <span class="badge badge-secondary">Inactive</span> label have either served their purpose or are otherwise no longer actively supported. If you‚Äôd like to resume or adapt one of these, submit a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing">project exploration worksheet</a> at an upcoming Hack Night or in Slack‚Äôs #leadership channel.</p>

<h3 id="decommissioned-projects">Decommissioned projects</h3>

<p>Projoects with the <span class="badge badge-dark">Decommissioned</span> label are projects that the Steering Committee has formally reviewed and deemed no longer a good fit for OpenOakland based on our 2020 project evaluation pilot. These projects may not be reinstated without submitting a new <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k24P9JiAUEzJLPFRDjVh7aRZexax6NUhfPFLSI3R80M/edit?usp=sharing">project exploration worksheet</a> that substantively addresses the original reasons for discontinuation. Project briefs that are declined by the Steering Committee twice may not be resubmitted without substantive changes.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="providing-feedback">Providing feedback</h2>

<p>In the spirit of continuous improvement and self-reflection, we welcome any and all feedback on OpenOakland projects past and present, as well as the overall project management process. Ways you can share your input include:</p>

<ul>

From informal chats to hands-on workshops, we love to celebrate the many perspectives and experiences in Oakland and beyond. We're especially interested in elevating the Town's underrepresented voices. To support this effort while fairly compensating speakers for their time and effort, we can usually offer a modest stipend.

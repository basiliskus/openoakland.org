'Though a lot of jargon is thrown around, some of the people here have no tech backgrounds at all, including Anna Mathai. “I just wanted to know more about Oakland politics and budget,” she says. “Just about government. And I just find this to be a good forum to, I think, help foster transparency and open government. But also get plugged into what's happening where, and what's going to happen with the next election, and other initiatives.'

'Oaklanders have always had a fierce penchant for community organizing. But until very recently, 'grassroots activism' didn't exactly conjure up the image of a bunch of self-described data nerds with their laptops in tow talking about code. But venture out to Oakland City Hall on most Tuesdays nights and you'll find Open Oakland, a group of self-described 'civic hackers' intent on using government data and technology to create better ways of engaging citizens. ...'

_April 30, 2013 - East Bay Express, Ellen Cushing_  
'a new project that aims to use data visualization to give average people the tools they need to understand — and, in turn, get involved with — Oakland's budgeting process, just went live a few days ago (in beta at least) and [it's pretty sweet](http://openbudgetoakland.org/).'

_March 30, 2013 - Ars Technica, Cyrus Farivar_  
'City officials see CFA and other parallel hacktivist projects, like OpenOakland, as a welcome (and low-cost) effort to aid a city under strain. They don’t expect technology to solve all of the Oakland’s problems, but they believe it might alleviate a small portion of the city’s challenges.'

'This past Saturday was International Open Data Day, and with it came hackathons hosted in dozens of cities on five continents all simultaneously tinkering with apps, visualizations, data catalogs and new standards built on the world’s growing trove of public data. Of course, put a bunch of mapping geeks and civic hackers in a room – many rooms, all over the world.'

'So far, Oakland Wiki’s only stated guidelines are that the wiki is free and anyone can edit it ...

[**Cracking Oakland's Code - Can a group of hackers figure out new answers to the city's old problems?**](https://eastbayexpress.com/cracking-oaklands-code-1/)
_1/2/2013 - East Bay Express, Azeen Ghorayshi_  
'I think one of the biggest problems we've faced is that whenever government operates in a closed fashion, it just asks for and results in distrust and concern that government isn't doing what it's meant to be doing and isn't willing to be questioned,' said OpenOakland's Steve Spiker. 'But there is a love for this city that's very strong and very rich, and it's got a history of social activism that's carried over in a lot of ways to the tech community.'

## 2012 - OpenOakland starts up

'Steve Spiker: "CityCamp Oakland was about supporting open government and we all witnessed some genuine interest in seeing this happen from city staff with a real desire to partner with us and others to make this happen. Our team put a ton of effort into creating an event to show appreciation to our city staff and to create a safe, encouraging place for us all to have open, frank conversations about how we can all collaborate to make our city even greater, for all our residents, not just the tech community."'

Thanks to a grant from the [Knight News Challenge](http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/20094016/), LocalWiki has been further developing the software so that communities anywhere can replicate the idea. The Raleigh-Durham Triangle area launched one earlier this year. Now [Oakland](https://oaklandwiki.org/) and [Ann Arbor](http://arborwiki.org/) have wikis, too. As a sign of true global dominance, a LocalWiki project is even coming to Antarctica.

**Meet Our Vanguard: Stephen Spiker**  
_10/8/12 - Next American City, Kate Holmquist_  
Stephen Spiker is brigade co-captain for the new start-up OpenOakland, a volunteer group of hackers, software engineers and civic advocates who build open source technology to tackle civic issues that government doesn’t have the resources to undertake. Spiker loves data, democracy and design. Oh, and he’s a new dad, too.

[**OpenOakland Brigade tries to unite techies, community advocates and city hall**](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2012/09/04/openoakland-brigade-tries-to-unite-techies-community-advocates-and-city-hall/)  
_9/4/12 - Oakland Tribune, Angela Woodall_  
The Brigade project started as a way to create a national network of cities whose residents were leveraging technology to improve their community. The Gov 2.0 civic tech movement is a growing one but tools developed in one city were being reinvented in others.
